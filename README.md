# Supply-Chain-Risk-Classification-and-Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting delivery time deviations using exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, Bayesian inference, and time-series forecasting. The goal is to identify key factors affecting delivery delays, assess risk classification, and develop predictive models to improve logistics efficiency.

The model focuses on :
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key metrics like delivery delays, fuel consumption, and congestion levels.
Identify patterns and anomalies using statistical tests and Bayesian analysis.
Develop time-series forecasting models (SARIMAX, ARIMA) to predict future deviations in delivery time.
Classify risk levels based on congestion, probability of delay, and other influencing factors.
